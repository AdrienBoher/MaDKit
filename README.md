MaDKit: The Multiagent Development Kit
================================================

What is MaDKit ?
-----------------

MaDKit is a multiagent-based development platform written in Java.
MaDKit is designed to easily build distributed applications and simulations using the multiagent paradigm and features:

* Artificial agents creation and life cycle management
* An organizational infrastructure for communication between agents, structuring the application
* High heterogeneity in agent architectures: No predefined agent model
* Multi-Agent based simulation and simulator authoring tools
* Multi-agent based distributed application authoring facilities

In contrast to conventional approaches, which are mostly agent-centered, MaDKit follows an organization-centered approach [OCMAS][1]
so that there is no predefnied agent model in MaDKit. So, MaDKit is built upon the AGR (Agent/Group/Role) organizational model:
MaDKit agents play roles in groups and thus create artificial societies.
